# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: January 1 - 4th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
Beginning this journey, I did not document the first few days. That said, in this time, I worked on getting started with The Odin Project. My goal is to finish project: Etch-a-Sketch by Wednesday 1/8. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am excited to start this journey and really challenging myself to learn more every day. My goal is to finish The Odin Project and start working on creating my personal website.

Day 7/1: January 7, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Well, I already failed at the 100 day challenge, skipped a day so her we are again my old friends. Back to day 1, which is okay. I want to do this right, so if I have to start over--then, I have to start over. Today I worked on Project 1 of The Odin Project, which is recreating the Google homepage only using CSS and HTML. 

**Thoughts:** 
It has been a second since doing a project like this so it is nice to go back to the basics and try to replicate a page. This project also reminding me how important developer tools in chrome are.  I will say that my first pass on the static webpage is not the best. There is alot of duplcation and not the most organized code. I am going to leave it how it though so that the next time I am working on something tough, I can go back in here and clean it up.

### Day 1: May 12th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for 1 hour from the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp 

**Thoughts:** 
Okay, starting this over again because as you can see from above... I didn't get too far. Now that I am finished with school, I think I can actually ccommit to doing this again. Today I picked up where I left off on the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp courses that I started last year. My end goal for the next three months will be to rotate between a few different topics.  My main interests include learning Web Dev, Ruby (on Rails), improving my knowledge base on Jave and preparing for coding interview questions. Along with that, I want to work on some personal projects including building out my personal website, creating an few different integrations for work, creating a site for my mom's business and integrating it with a Braintree sandbox. I have a lot of goals set for the next 6 months but I am confident that I will be able to get through them. So here is to the beginning!

### Day 2: May 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a little over 3 hours from the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. Completed the Intro to Bootstrap 4 section and started the Intermediate Bootstrap section

**Thoughts:** 
Wow, I am excited again. While I learned a lot in school, I am sooooo happy to be finally done. I finally have the time to learn about topics that interest me the most. I have been slowly upgrading my office and desk specs and feel like I am getting to the place where I am more confident in my skills and set up. I can't believe I graduated with a Software Engineer degree. Anissa 10 years ago would have said I was crazy. Anyway... I am excited again. Excited to learn and mostly, excited to grow.
