# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1 - 4th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
Beginning this journey, I did not document the first few days. That said, in this time, I worked on getting started with The Odin Project. My goal is to finish project: Etch-a-Sketch by Wednesday 1/8. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am excited to start this journey and really challenging myself to learn more every day. My goal is to finish The Odin Project and start working on creating my personal website.

### Day 7/1: January 7, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Well, I already failed at the 100 day challenge, skipped a day so her we are again my old friends. Back to day 1, which is okay. I want to do this right, so if I have to start over--then, I have to start over. Today I worked on Project 1 of The Odin Project, which is recreating the Google homepage only using CSS and HTML. 

**Thoughts:** 
It has been a second since doing a project like this so it is nice to go back to the basics and try to replicate a page. This project also reminding me how important developer tools in chrome are.  I will say that my first pass on the static webpage is not the best. There is alot of duplcation and not the most organized code. I am going to leave it how it though so that the next time I am working on something tough, I can go back in here and clean it up.
