# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 1: May 12th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for 1 hour from the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp 

**Thoughts:** 
Okay, starting this over again because as you can see from above... I didn't get too far. Now that I am finished with school, I think I can actually ccommit to doing this again. Today I picked up where I left off on the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp courses that I started last year. My end goal for the next three months will be to rotate between a few different topics.  My main interests include learning Web Dev, Ruby (on Rails), improving my knowledge base on Jave and preparing for coding interview questions. Along with that, I want to work on some personal projects including building out my personal website, creating an few different integrations for work, creating a site for my mom's business and integrating it with a Braintree sandbox. I have a lot of goals set for the next 6 months but I am confident that I will be able to get through them. So here is to the beginning!

### Day 2: May 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a little over 3 hours from the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. Completed the Intro to Bootstrap 4 section and started the Intermediate Bootstrap section

**Thoughts:** 
Wow, I am excited again. While I learned a lot in school, I am sooooo happy to be finally done. I finally have the time to learn about topics that interest me the most. I have been slowly upgrading my office and desk specs and feel like I am getting to the place where I am more confident in my skills and set up. I can't believe I graduated with a Software Engineer degree. Anissa 10 years ago would have said I was crazy. Anyway... I am excited again. Excited to learn and mostly, excited to grow.

### Day 3: May 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a about an hour and a half on the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. I continued Intermediate Bootstrap section learning about Bootstrap Carousel, Cards, and CSS Stacking Order. 

**Thoughts:** 
Today was a little rough just because it is the end of the week for me at work so I was feeling a little tired. I also found out that they are extending our WFH order due to Coronavirus until October. This news definitely shook me up a bit because I miss going into the office and seeing my coworkers. I miss colaborating with my team and was hoping to have that again sooner than October. Sigh... 2020 is cancelled. That said, since it is my weekend, I am off tomorrow and Saturday. I also took Sunday off so this is the start of my 3 day weekend. Yay! I plan to jump into a different course tomorrow to learn something else, might take a look at some of the SOLID principles courses on Udemy.

### Day 4: May 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a about an hour on Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. I continued Intermediate Bootstrap section learning about different media queries in native CSS. 

**Thoughts:** 
Today, I just worked for a little over an hour to make sure to get in my day of coding. Since I knew I wasn't going to be able to do too much today, I stuck with the same Udemy course but hope to look at SOLID principles tomorrow.
