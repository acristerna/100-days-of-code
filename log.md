### Day 1: January 1 - 4th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
Beginning this journey, I did not document the first few days. That said, in this time I worked on getting started with The Odin Project. My goal is to Project: Etch-a-Sketch by Wednesday 1/8 

**Thoughts:** 
I am excited to start this journey and really challenging myself to learn more every day.
