# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 1: May 12th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for 1 hour from the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp 

**Thoughts:** 
Okay, starting this over again because as you can see from above... I didn't get too far. Now that I am finished with school, I think I can actually ccommit to doing this again. Today I picked up where I left off on the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp courses that I started last year. My end goal for the next three months will be to rotate between a few different topics.  My main interests include learning Web Dev, Ruby (on Rails), improving my knowledge base on Jave and preparing for coding interview questions. Along with that, I want to work on some personal projects including building out my personal website, creating an few different integrations for work, creating a site for my mom's business and integrating it with a Braintree sandbox. I have a lot of goals set for the next 6 months but I am confident that I will be able to get through them. So here is to the beginning!

### Day 2: May 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a little over 3 hours from the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. Completed the Intro to Bootstrap 4 section and started the Intermediate Bootstrap section

**Thoughts:** 
Wow, I am excited again. While I learned a lot in school, I am sooooo happy to be finally done. I finally have the time to learn about topics that interest me the most. I have been slowly upgrading my office and desk specs and feel like I am getting to the place where I am more confident in my skills and set up. I can't believe I graduated with a Software Engineer degree. Anissa 10 years ago would have said I was crazy. Anyway... I am excited again. Excited to learn and mostly, excited to grow.

### Day 3: May 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a about an hour and a half on the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. I continued Intermediate Bootstrap section learning about Bootstrap Carousel, Cards, and CSS Stacking Order. 

**Thoughts:** 
Today was a little rough just because it is the end of the week for me at work so I was feeling a little tired. I also found out that they are extending our WFH order due to Coronavirus until October. This news definitely shook me up a bit because I miss going into the office and seeing my coworkers. I miss colaborating with my team and was hoping to have that again sooner than October. Sigh... 2020 is cancelled. That said, since it is my weekend, I am off tomorrow and Saturday. I also took Sunday off so this is the start of my 3 day weekend. Yay! I plan to jump into a different course tomorrow to learn something else, might take a look at some of the SOLID principles courses on Udemy.

### Day 4: May 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a about an hour on Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. I continued Intermediate Bootstrap section learning about different media queries in native CSS. 

**Thoughts:** 
Today, I just worked for a little over an hour to make sure to get in my day of coding. Since I knew I wasn't going to be able to do too much today, I stuck with the same Udemy course but hope to look at SOLID principles tomorrow.

### Day 5: May 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a about an hour and a half on Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. I continued Intermediate Bootstrap section learning about refactoring and how to best combine CSS selectors. Only have a couple of sub-sections left and then there is a mini section on UX/UI before moving to JavaScript! :)

**Thoughts:** 
I worked for a little bit on the Web Dev course and still plan to look at SOLID principles later tonight. I just wanted to get in a little bit more time before changing to the other course.

### Day 6: May 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a about a half hour on Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and finished the Intermediate Bootstrap Section. Next, I will be starting a mini section on UX/UI. I then started two other Udemy courses on SOLID Principles, one called, "Using SOLID Principles to Write Better Code - A Crash Course" and the other, "SOLID Principles: Introducing Software Architecture & Design". For both, I started with Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Total time today was about 3.5 hours. 

**Thoughts:** 
I really enjoyed today's time. I think finishing a Udemy section of the big web dev course is nice motivation and I am excited to start the Javascript section. I previously learned about SRP in school but did feel like I learned a new perspective on it, as well as have a better understanding of the concept. I also want to share what I am learning on my coding Instagram, so I started working on some post content in AdobeXD. It has been a second since I have used XD but it was nice to jump back into design again.

### Day 7: May 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked for a little over an hour on the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and finished the UI/UX section.

**Thoughts:** 
Today's thoughts are a little simple. I am just happy to finish another section of the course. There wasn't much coding to this section so nothing really for me to push. Going to pick up the Javascript section tomorrow though! Yay!

### Day 8: May 19th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the Javascript section of the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and worked for about 2 hours on it. I learned about Javascript variables, data types, and naming conventions. 

**Thoughts:** 
It is interesting learning certain things in this course, like variables for Javascript, because I have already learned Java in school. What I mean by that is that programming languages are all kind of similar. Don't get me wrong Java and Javascript are really different, I just mean that I feel familiar with some of it. When I first started programming, I would always hear, "Once you know one language, you can learn any other." I think I am finally getting to that point where I feel confident in that saying. I think knowing Java will definitely help me learn some of this web dev stuff faster, and probably will even be beneficial for when I start the Ruby on Rails course too. 

**Link to work:** 
Today, we just practiced some small Javascript exercises so nothing to push again today. 

### Day 9: May 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Javascript section of the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and worked for about an hour on it. I learned about about Javascript String concatenation, length, and retrieving the number of characters.

**Thoughts:** 
It has been a little difficult with all of the Coronavirus stuff to make sure that I am adding these logs everyday but I have maintained my 1 hour a day. Since I work nights, I usually code after I get off so the dates might be a little off.

**Link to work:**  Just taking in the course and doing small amounts of JS code, so once again no code pushes for today. 
 
### Day 10: May 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Continued the Javascript section of the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and worked for about another hour on it. I learned about about Javascript String slicing and extracting, changing String casing, and working through basic arithmetic. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am excited about incorporating JS into new projects. Today was a little rouugh again, we are thinking about heading to MI for a little to get out of the city. Trying to find little things to keep me motivated during this time. I bought some wall art to put up above my desk and they are bringing me joy. 

**Link to work:** Small exercises but decided to create a running JS file of them so I can push something. I missed a few of the earlier ones but added some of the String and math practices.

 ### Day 11: May 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Javascript section of the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and worked for about two hours on it. I learned about creating and calling functions and did a few small assignments working with the Standford's Karel IDE which works by given commands to a robot. 

**Thoughts:** 
I had a lot of fun today. These were simple fuctions and I defintely understood the material. I am excited to learn more and finishing up the basic Javascript section of the course.

### Day 12: May 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Woot Woot! Completed the beginning level of the Javascript section for The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and worked for about two hours on it. I learned about passing parameters, arguments, and output and returns. We also had two coding challanges for creaing a BMI calculate and functions quiz. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am excited that I got through another section, I can't wait to jump into the intermediate section. I just want to start putting everything I have leaned all together.

### Day 13: May 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the Intermediate Javascript section of the The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and worked for about two hours on it. This included going over generating random numbers using the Math.random function and then building a love compatibility generator based off of a random percentage. I also worked through Control statements using if and if else. I learned the different comparator and how to tell the different between == and ===. We also had two coding challenges, one for a BMI calulator update and another on how to create a function that can tell whether a year is leap or not. 

**Thoughts:** I think it is because it is late but I was struggling with the logic on the leap year function. Once I took a second to think about it and look at the flow chart, I was able to figure it out though. The next section jumps into Arrays and I am excited about that because I definitely think I understand Arrays well.

### Day 14: May 25th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked for 2 hours on the Intermediate Javascript section of the The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. I am almost done with this section and will probably finish it up tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** Another day bites the dust. Just keeping and moving.
